# Kata Java [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/matchilling/kata-java.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/matchilling/kata-java)

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their
skills through practice and repetition. The term was probably first coined by
Dave Thomas, co-author of the book "The Pragmatic Programmer", in a bow to the
Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.
