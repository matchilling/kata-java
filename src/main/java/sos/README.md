# SOS Parser

A spaceship crashed on Mars! It sends a series of SOS messages to Earth for
help.

Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during
transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, determine how
many letters of the spaceship's SOS have been changed by radiation.

For example, Earth receives `SOSTOT`. The spaceships's original message was
`SOSSOS`. Two of the message characters were changed in transit.
